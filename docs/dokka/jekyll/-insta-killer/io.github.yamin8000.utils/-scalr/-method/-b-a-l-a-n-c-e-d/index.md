# BALANCED



[jvm]\
[BALANCED](index.html)()



Used to indicate that the scaling implementation should use a scaling operation balanced between SPEED and QUALITY. Sometimes SPEED looks too low quality to be useful (e.g. text can become unreadable when scaled using SPEED) but using QUALITY mode will increase the processing time too much. This mode provides a "better than SPEED" quality in a "less than QUALITY" amount of time.
