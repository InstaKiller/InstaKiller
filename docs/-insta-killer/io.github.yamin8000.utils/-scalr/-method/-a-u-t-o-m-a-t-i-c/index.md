# AUTOMATIC



[jvm]\
[AUTOMATIC](index.html)()



Used to indicate that the scaling implementation should decide which method to use in order to get the best looking scaled image in the least amount of time.



The scaling algorithm will use the [Scalr.THRESHOLD_QUALITY_BALANCED](../../-t-h-r-e-s-h-o-l-d_-q-u-a-l-i-t-y_-b-a-l-a-n-c-e-d.html) or [Scalr.THRESHOLD_BALANCED_SPEED](../../-t-h-r-e-s-h-o-l-d_-b-a-l-a-n-c-e-d_-s-p-e-e-d.html) thresholds as cut-offs to decide between selecting the QUALITY, BALANCED or SPEED scaling algorithms.



By default the thresholds chosen will give nearly the best looking result in the fastest amount of time. We intend this method to work for 80% of people looking to scale an image quickly and get a good looking result.
