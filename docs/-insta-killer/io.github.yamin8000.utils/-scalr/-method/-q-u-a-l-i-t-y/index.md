# QUALITY



[jvm]\
[QUALITY](index.html)()



Used to indicate that the scaling implementation should do everything it can to create as nice of a result as possible. This approach is most important for smaller pictures (800px or smaller) and less important for larger pictures as the difference between this method and the SPEED method become less and less noticeable as the source-image size increases. Using the AUTOMATIC method will automatically prefer the QUALITY method when scaling an image down below 800px in size.
