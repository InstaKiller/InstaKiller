# FLIP_VERT



[jvm]\
[FLIP_VERT](index.html)()



Flip the image vertically by reflecting it around the x axis.



This is not a standard rotation around a center point, but instead creates the mirrored reflection of the image vertically.



More specifically, the horizontal orientation of the image stays the same (the left stays on the left and the right stays on the right), but the top and bottom sides flip. This is different than a standard rotation where the left and right would also have been flipped.
